# How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?

To ensure that each card is received once and only once, the recipient should post a sign describing which cards have already been received. For this to work, each card must have an unique identifier. Every time the recipient receives a card, the recipient should add the unique identifier to the sign displayed to senders.

If the sender sees that the card they are trying to send has an id on the list of the recipient. The sender should cancel the transfer.

To prevent the list of cards from being too long. The sign can be periodically cleared after the message being sent has been completed for a short while.
